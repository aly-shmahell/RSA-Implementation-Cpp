# RSA-Implementation-C
(Key Generation, Encryption, Decryption, 2^32 base arithmatic operations)

C++ implementation of RSA algortihm for BigInteger numbers. 

In this project, a C++ implementation has been provided to perform RSA encryption and
decryption for up to 3072 bits of N value. The project also includes random public and private key
generation for RSA algorithm. In order to achieve the desired results, the design includes methods
for basic operations of N bit numbers. The performance of these methods were compared with a
Java BigInteger implementation on the same workstation. It was found that the implemented
methods in this project provides better latency compared to the Java BigInteger class.
